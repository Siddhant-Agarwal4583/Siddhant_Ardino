Lia is an artist , hosting an exhibition. She appointed two of her children Joe and Jack to keep a count of the number of visitors at any 
moment inside the room. Due to the large number of visitors, Joe and Jack could not synchronise their countings at the only 2 doors of the room.
One door is for entry and the other is for exit, is a strict rule. Crowd is genuine and it follows the rules.
To make it accurate, Jack is asking for your help in order to maintain the count of people in one room at any moment.
HELP HIM!
