# Pro-Arduino

Folder of question will be named as **X Points Problem**. Here *X* is the maximum points that one gets on providing correct code for that problem.
Every question problem contains a **readme**.In the readme you will find the problem
All the qualified participants shall abide the following conditions:
1. In every Problem a folder is created for accepting solutions. The folder is named **Answers**. 
2. Every Participant must create a folder of his/her name in **Answer** folder.
3. In that folder he should submit the following: 
    - **.cpp/.txt** file that contains the code which is exactly same as in your tinkercad account.
    - Tinkercad Link of your circuit
    - send a pull request on the main folder
4.  Please take care of the following things on tinkercad:
    - All the **components used should be labeled** so thats its not tedious for the judges to understand them.
    - The code written on tinkercad should be properly intended. In case of tie presentation and board assembly will be tie breakers.
    - **Make sure that you make your circuit public so that judges can see it. If its private then the submission will be rejected**.
5. In the following cases we will disqualify a participant:
    - Code on tinkercad is altered after the submission deadline.
    - There are commits after the submission deadline in their pull request.
    - There is some plagarizim in your code
6. In the following cases we will reject a submission:
    - Pull request is not made in the correct folder as mentioned above.
    - Tinkercad link is not public or accessable.
    - Submission after the deadline.
